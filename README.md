 #### You can always count on me when
 
 I like having fun and getting to know everyone face to face.
 Will be a lot more pleasant when I get comfortable using the terminal,github,phpstorm,HTML & CSS :P.

##### A funny Story

After graduating high school some friends & me went on a trip to bodrum.
We ended up buying some tickets for ' Club Katamaran'
from someone in our hotel who ensured us it was a must do party.
It was only after arriving that we realized
that the boat was full of transgenders and we couldn't get of because they shipped us into sea.
Not the ideal place for a bunch of 18yo single guys but had a lot of fun either way.

###### TL;DR

Make the best out of all situations.
